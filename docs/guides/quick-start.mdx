# Fumadocs Framework: Quick Start

Getting Started with Fumadocs

## Introduction

Fumadocs is a **documentation framework**, designed to be fast, flexible, and composes seamlessly into your React framework.

Fumadocs has different parts:

### Fumadocs Core
Handles most of the logic, including document search, content source adapters, and Markdown extensions.

### Fumadocs UI
The default theme of Fumadocs offers a beautiful look for documentation sites and interactive components.

### Content Source
The source of your content, can be a CMS or local data layers like Fumadocs MDX (the official content source).

### Fumadocs CLI
A command line tool to install UI components and automate things, useful for customizing layouts.

### Terminology

**Markdown/MDX:** Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text. Fumadocs natively supports Markdown and MDX (superset of Markdown).

**[Bun](https://bun.sh):** A JavaScript runtime, we use it for running scripts.

Some basic knowledge of React.js would be useful for further customisations.

## Automatic Installation

A minimum version of Node.js 20 required.

### npm
```bash
npm create fumadocs-app
```

### pnpm
```bash
pnpm create fumadocs-app
```

### yarn
```bash
yarn create fumadocs-app
```

### bun
```bash
bun create fumadocs-app
```

It will ask you the built-in template to use:

* **React.js framework**: Next.js, Waku, React Router, Tanstack Start.
* **Content source**: Fumadocs MDX.

A new fumadocs app should be initialized. Now you can start hacking!

> **From Existing Codebase?**
> You can follow the [Manual Installation](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/docs/ui/manual-installation) guide to get started.

### Enjoy!

Create your first MDX file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs).

**npm:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**pnpm:**
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

**yarn:**
```bash
yarn dev
```

**bun:**
```bash
bun run dev
```

## FAQ

Some common questions you may encounter.

### Getting error with missing APIs or bugs?

Make sure to upgrade Fumadocs when you've encountered any problems or trying out new features:

```bash
pnpm update -i -r --latest
```

### How to change the base route of docs?

Routing is handled by your React framework, you need to change the routing structure first.

For example, in Next.js, rename the route (`/docs/*` -> `/info/*`):

Finally, update the base URL of pages in `source.ts`:

```ts title="lib/source.ts"
import { loader } from 'fumadocs-core/source';

export const source = loader({
  baseUrl: '/info', // to the new value
});
```

### How to implement multi-docs?

We recommend to use [Sidebar Tabs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/docs/ui/navigation/sidebar#sidebar-tabs).

## For Vite

### Getting error with React contexts?

There's some weird pre-bundling problems with Vite: [#3910](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/3910).
Make sure to exclude Fumadocs from pre-bundling and add it to `noExternal`:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

// add other Fumadocs deps as needed
const FumadocsDeps = ['fumadocs-core', 'fumadocs-ui'];

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    noExternal: FumadocsDeps,
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: FumadocsDeps,
  },
});
```

## For Next.js

### Getting error on production build?

Node.js 23.1 might have problems with Next.js, see [#1021](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs/issues/1021). Make sure to change your Node.js version.

### It uses Dynamic Route, will it be poor in performance?

Next.js turns dynamic route into static routes when `generateStaticParams` is configured.
Hence, it is as fast as static pages.

You can [enable Static Exports](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/docs/ui/static-export) on Next.js to get a static build output.

### How to create a page in /docs without docs layout?

Same as managing layouts in Next.js App Router, remove the original MDX file from content directory (`/content/docs`).
This ensures duplicated pages will not cause errors.

Now, You can add the page to another route group, which isn't a descendant of docs layout.
