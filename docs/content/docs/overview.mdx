# Trino Overview

Trino is a distributed SQL query engine designed to efficiently query large amounts of data using distributed queries.

## Architecture

Trino follows a coordinator-worker architecture:

### Coordinator

The coordinator is responsible for:
- Parsing SQL statements
- Planning queries
- Managing worker nodes
- Coordinating query execution

### Workers

Workers are responsible for:
- Executing tasks
- Processing data
- Returning results to the coordinator

## Query Execution

Trino uses a pipelined execution model that processes data in memory whenever possible, resulting in:

- Low latency queries
- High throughput
- Efficient resource utilization

## Connectors

Trino can query data from multiple sources simultaneously using connectors:

- **Relational databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
- **NoSQL databases**: MongoDB, Cassandra
- **Cloud storage**: S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage
- **Data warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
- **And many more...**

## Use Cases

Trino is ideal for:

- Interactive analytics
- Ad-hoc queries
- Data lake analytics
- Federated queries across multiple data sources
- ETL operations
